# HireLoom AI Agent - Project Rules & Guidelines

## üéØ Project Philosophy

**Primary Goal: Help Shivansh Learn AI Technologies**

- This project is a **learning platform** for Shivansh to master new AI/ML technologies and concepts
- **Learn by Building**: Cursor will help implement LangChain, LangGraph, RAG, and other cutting-edge AI tools
- **Hands-on Exploration**: Cursor will guide deep dives into each technology through practical implementation
- **Document Learning Journey**: Cursor will help capture insights, challenges, and breakthroughs as we explore
- **Build Understanding**: Cursor will explain how and why each technology works, not just implement it

## üèóÔ∏è Development Approach

### Learning-Focused Principles

1. **One Sub-task at a Time**: Cursor will help tackle one specific component/feature per session
2. **Explain Before Implementing**: Cursor will explain concepts and patterns before coding
3. **Build Incrementally**: Cursor will start with simple implementations, then guide complexity
4. **Document Decisions**: Cursor will explain why specific patterns/approaches were chosen
5. **Test Understanding**: Cursor will help write tests that verify both functionality and understanding

### Code Quality Standards

- **Clean, Modular Code**: Break functionality into reusable components
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Minimal Comments**: Only comment non-obvious logic; prefer self-explanatory code
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript-style typing with Python type hints, avoid `any`
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic, data access, and presentation separate

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Preferences

### Backend Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Vector Database**: pgvector for embeddings and similarity search
- **HTTP Client**: Axios-style with `httpx` (not `requests`)
- **Entry Point**: `src/main.py` (not `src/hireloom/main.py`)

## üìÅ Architecture Guidelines

### Directory Structure

```
src/hireloom/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Domain models, schemas, business rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/         # AI agents (base, recruitment, orchestrator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/      # LangGraph workflows and state management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/       # Business logic services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integrations/   # External service adapters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/           # FastAPI routes and dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db/            # Database models and migrations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/         # Shared utilities
```

### Design Patterns

- **Adapter Pattern**: For external integrations (LLM, calendar, messaging)
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separated from data access
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating agents and workflows
- **Observer Pattern**: For event-driven communication

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Session Planning

1. **Start with Questions**: Cursor will clarify requirements and approach before coding
2. **Propose Step-by-Step Plan**: Cursor will present a plan and wait for approval
3. **One Focus Area**: Cursor will concentrate on one sub-task per session
4. **Document Learnings**: Cursor will help capture insights and architectural decisions

### Code Implementation

1. **Explain First**: Cursor will explain existing code before modifying
2. **Start Simple**: Cursor will begin with basic implementation, then guide enhancement
3. **Test Early**: Cursor will help write tests as you build, not after
4. **Refactor Often**: Cursor will guide code structure improvements as understanding grows

### Quality Gates

- All code must pass linting (ruff + mypy)
- Tests must be written for new functionality
- Documentation must be updated for architectural changes
- Code reviews focus on learning and understanding
- All commits must follow Conventional Commits specification
