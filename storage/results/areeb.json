        "Mivro: Developed cross-platform app and web extension for personalized product profiling in food, drink, cosmetic, medicine, and pet food categories. Integrated Claude API to categorize nutrients based on user-specific health data, analyse health risks associated, and recommend healthier food options or lifestyle changes. Implemented custom searching algorithm using fuzzy matching and keyword clustering techniques to accurately retrieve products from the database based on complex user queries.",
        "Crypta: Developed automated digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) system designed for anomaly detection and pattern recognition across system data and network activity. Implemented YARA rules with LSTM model for IoC detection (96% accuracy, 20% fewer false positives) and used Scapy to automate network analysis of HTTP, DNS, and IP packets. Generated summarized results using ReportLab library, providing real-time data visualization on the dashboard and export options in PDF, JSON, and CSV formats.",
        "GodsEye: Developed automated news feedback system providing data visualizations on news article sentiment, organization-wise distribution, and overall coverage insights from selected news agencies. Implemented an asynchronous pipeline with Httpx to scrape articles and applied the Gemini API for trend, keyword, and sentiment analysis. Designed UI using Streamlit framework and Plotly library to generate dynamic data visualizations using bar charts, pie charts, line charts, area charts, and more."
