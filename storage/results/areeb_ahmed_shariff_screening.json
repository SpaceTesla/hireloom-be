  "experience_match": "The candidate has 1.25 years of total experience, exceeding the 3+ months requirement for a junior role.

  "hiring_recommendation": "Maybe",
  "confidence_level": "Medium",
  "reasoning": "Areeb demonstrates strong technical aptitude, a broad skill set, and impressive project work, particularly in DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and AI integration. They have more than the minimum required experience for a junior role. However, the core frontend technologies (React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, specific CSS frameworks, and testing frameworks) are largely missing from their profile. While they have built web UIs with Streamlit and Flutter, these are not the technologies specified in the job description. Their current role as a DevOps Intern further indicates a different primary focus. While they possess strong foundational skills and high potential, the direct technical match for this specific frontend role is weak, requiring significant upskilling. The 'Maybe' recommendation reflects their high potential and general technical strength, balanced against the significant gaps in required frontend skills.",
  "interview_focus_areas": [
    "Assess their genuine interest and motivation for a dedicated frontend role, specifically with React/Next.js and TypeScript.",
    "Gauge their learning agility and how quickly they believe they can pick up new frontend frameworks and libraries.",
    "Explore their understanding of core frontend concepts (DOM manipulation, browser rendering, JavaScript fundamentals, responsive design principles) even without specific framework experience.",
    "Discuss their approach to problem-solving and debugging in a web application context.",
    "Evaluate soft skills: collaboration, communication, and their approach to participating in code reviews and technical discussions.",
    "Ask about their experience with UI/UX principles and working with designers.",
    "Explore their understanding of state management concepts and how they would approach it in a frontend application."

  "salary_expectations": "Junior Developer range, dependent on location and company's compensation structure for remote roles. Given their strong general technical background, it might be slightly above entry-level for a junior position, but adjusted for the need to upskill in core frontend technologies.",
  "onboarding_plan": "If hired, an intensive onboarding plan focused on frontend development would be crucial. This should include: dedicated resources and mentorship for React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, and relevant CSS frameworks; initial pair programming with experienced frontend developers; starting with smaller, well-defined frontend tasks to build confidence and familiarity; providing detailed feedback during code reviews to accelerate learning; and potentially assigning a small internal project using the required stack. Their DevOps background can be leveraged for understanding deployment and integration, but the primary focus must be on frontend skill development."
