    "Built a dynamic customer portal with Next.js and Tailwind CSS where users browse restaurant menus and select catering combos, driving a seamless ordering flow. Integrated WhatsApp and email notifications: when a combo is chosen, the site packages order details and dispatches them via WhatsApp API and SMTP for real-time client communication.",
    "Built a fast, visually engaging website using Next.js with attention to responsive design and smooth user experience. Led technical SEO efforts including image optimization, robots.txt, sitemaps, and the Google Search Console setup to improve search visibility.",
    "Architected with Manifest V3: used a background script (service worker) to securely fetch nutritional data from the API (with rate-limit handling) and passed it to content scripts via message channels. Injected a real-time UI overlay by leveraging DOM MutationObservers plus dynamic CSS/JS insertion to render categorized nutrient scores, health-risk flags, and fallback logic for offline or blocked API calls."
