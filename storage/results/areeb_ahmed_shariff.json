    "Developed cross-platform app and web extension for personalized product profiling in food, drink, cosmetic, medicine, and pet food categories. Integrated Claude API to categorize nutrients, analyse health risks, and recommend healthier food options or lifestyle changes. Implemented custom searching algorithm using fuzzy matching and keyword clustering.",
    "Developed automated digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) system designed for anomaly detection and pattern recognition across system data and network activity. Implemented YARA rules with LSTM model for IoC detection (96% accuracy, 20% fewer false positives) and used Scapy to automate network analysis. Generated summarized results using ReportLab library.",
    "Developed automated news feedback system providing data visualizations on news article sentiment, organization-wise distribution, and overall coverage insights from selected news agencies. Implemented an asynchronous pipeline with Httpx to scrape articles and applied the Gemini API for trend, keyword, and sentiment analysis. Designed UI using Streamlit framework and Plotly library."
