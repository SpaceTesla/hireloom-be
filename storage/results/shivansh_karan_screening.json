  "experience_match": "Strong match. Shivansh significantly exceeds the minimum 3+ months experience requirement with 1 year of total experience. His project work demonstrates a level of technical depth and complexity that is impressive for a junior candidate, showcasing practical application of required skills.",
  "seniority_level": "Junior",
  "hiring_recommendation": "Strong Hire",
  "confidence_level": "High",
  "reasoning": "Shivansh presents as an exceptionally strong junior candidate for this Frontend Developer role. He demonstrates a deep understanding and practical application of core frontend technologies like React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS through his impressive projects. His hackathon achievements further highlight his problem-solving abilities, initiative, and capacity to deliver under pressure. While there are minor gaps in explicit experience with testing frameworks and accessibility standards, his overall technical prowess, rapid learning ability, and impressive project portfolio for his experience level make him a standout. The 'CTO' title at his experience level is unusual and warrants discussion but does not detract from his demonstrated frontend development skills. His potential for growth and contribution is very high, making him an excellent fit for a junior role with significant upside.",
  "interview_focus_areas": [
    "Deep dive into his 'CTO' role: responsibilities, team size, technical challenges faced, and how it aligns with a junior frontend developer position.",
    "Explore his experience with testing frameworks (Jest, React Testing Library) and how he approaches testing in his projects.",
    "Discuss his understanding and application of accessibility standards (WCAG) in his development work.",
    "Assess his approach to collaboration, participation in code reviews, and technical discussions.",
    "Probe into his understanding of design systems and how he would contribute to building reusable UI components.",
    "Behavioral questions to assess soft skills, teamwork, communication style, and problem-solving approach."
  ],
  "salary_expectations": "Given his junior level but exceptional technical aptitude, project experience, and demonstrated initiative, Shivansh would likely command a competitive junior to early-mid level salary. For a remote role, this could range from $60,000 - $80,000 USD annually, depending on the company's location and compensation structure.",
  "onboarding_plan": "1. Pair him with a senior frontend mentor to guide him through initial projects, company best practices, and codebase navigation.\n2. Provide resources and dedicated time for him to learn and implement testing frameworks (Jest/React Testing Library) and accessibility standards, integrating these into his early tasks.\n3. Integrate him into code review processes and encourage active participation in technical discussions from day one.\n4. Start him on smaller, well-defined tasks to get familiar with the codebase and team workflows, gradually increasing complexity.\n5. Encourage participation in internal knowledge-sharing sessions and workshops to leverage his diverse technical background and foster continuous learning."
